1. Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for a company’s communication system.
   1. Scope
This document will catalog the user, system, and hardware requirements for a company’s communication system.


   2. Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations
* Synchronously: Communication that occurs in real-time, allowing users to send and receive messages while they are connected.
* Asynchronously: Communication that occurs when users are not connected to the system. This means users can receive messages even when they are offline, and the messages are stored  until the user connects to the system..
* Chat privately: Conversation within the system that is exchanged exclusively between two users.
* Chat in groups: Conversation that enables multiple users to engage in a conversation simultaneously within a single chat.
* IT users: Individuals responsible for managing and maintaining the technical aspects of the system. 
* Ticket: A ticket serves as a help desk feature within the software. Its purpose is to track and manage users’ requests to reset or change passwords associated with their accounts.

2. Overall Description
   1. Product Perspective
The communication system strives to be user-friendly and reliable. It is designed to work seamlessly with different devices and systems, ensuring ease of use for everyone. Security is a top priority, guaranteeing that messages are kept safe and private. The system is also closely monitored to quickly address any issues, maintaining smooth operation for all users.
   2. Product Architecture
      1. Server module: Responsible for managing client-server communication, user authentication, message routing, and logging.
      2. Client GUI module: provides the graphical user interface (GUI) for users to interact with the system. This module ensures a user-friendly experience for clients interacting with the system.
      3. Communication module: Manages the core functionality of the chat system, including synchronous and asynchronous messaging, private and group chat functionalities, and real-time message delivery.
   3. Product Functionality/Features
      1. Chat functionality
* Synchronous chat: Enable real-time messaging between all users for instant communication.
* Asynchronous chat: Allow users to send and receive messages even when the recipient is offline, with messages delivered once the recipient reconnects.
* Private Chat: Facilitates one-on-one conversations between users.
* Group Chat: Allows multiple users to participate in a single conversation.
* Message formatting: Supports only text in user communication.
* User Management
* User Registration and Authentication: Provide a registration process for new users and secure authentication mechanisms to verify user identities.
* User Profiles: Allow users to create and customize their profiles with profile pictures, status messages, and contact information.
* Administration and Monitoring
* User Activity Monitoring: Allow IT users to monitor user activity, track login/logout times, and view user session information.
* Content Moderation: Give IT users tools to manage user content, like flagging inappropriate messages and handling user bans or suspensions.
* System Health Monitoring: Monitor system performance, resource utilization, and network traffic to identify and address potential issues proactively.




   4. Constraints
      1. The system needs to be permanently connected to an internet connection.
      2. The system only accepts text format for communication among all users.
      3. The system only accepts text characters that fall under the ASCII table.
      4. Scalability: The system should be scalable to accommodate future growth in the number of users and messages without needing major changes.
      5. Performance Limitations: The system must handle a large volume of messages and users without sacrificing performance or responsiveness.
      6. Platform Compatibility: Ensuring compatibility across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) and devices (desktops, laptops, mobile devices) may pose challenges.
   5. Assumptions and Dependencies
Assumptions:
1. The project assumes that the organization's network infrastructure is reliable and can support the demands of the communication system without significant interruptions.
2. The project assumes that users will readily adopt the new communication system and integrate it into their daily workflows.
3. The project assumes that users will receive adequate training and support to effectively utilize the features and functionalities of the communication system.
4. Assumes that the communication system is compatible with various devices and operating systems commonly used by employees within the organization.
5. Assumes that the data transmitted and stored within the communication system will remain accurate, consistent, and free from corruption or loss.


Dependencies:
1. The project may depend on user feedback and testing to identify areas for improvement and refine the features and usability of the communication system over time.
2. The project may depend on compliance with regulatory requirements, such as data protection laws and industry standards, which may impact the design and implementation of the communication system.
3. The project may depend on the network infrastructure since the organization's network needs to provide sufficient bandwidth, reliability, and security for the transmission of messages and data within the communication system.
